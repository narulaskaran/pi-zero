# MTA Subway Train Times Configuration
#
# Copy this file to config.yaml and configure your stations
#
# For each station, specify:
#   - name: Station name (for display)
#   - stop_id: Base stop ID without N/S suffix
#   - stop_ids: Multiple stop IDs for complex stations (optional)
#   - lat: Latitude for local weather (required for weather display)
#   - lon: Longitude for local weather (required for weather display)
#   - routes: List of train routes (e.g., ["B", "C"])
#   - directions: Custom labels for UPTOWN/DOWNTOWN sections
#
# Find stop IDs at: http://web.mta.info/developers/data/nyct/subway/Stations.csv
# Find coordinates via Google Maps (right-click a location > select coordinates)
#
# The script automatically:
#   - Determines which MTA feed to use based on routes
#   - Adds N/S suffixes for northbound/southbound
#   - Fetches both directions
#   - Consolidates trains by station, sorted by arrival time

# Number of upcoming trains to display per direction
num_trains: 10

# Stations to monitor
