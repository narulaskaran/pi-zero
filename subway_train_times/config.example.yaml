# MTA Subway Train Times Configuration
#
# Copy this file to config.yaml and configure your stations
#
# For each station, specify:
#   - name: Station name (for display)
#   - stop_id: Base stop ID without N/S suffix
#   - stop_ids: Multiple stop IDs for complex stations (optional)
#   - lat: Latitude for local weather (required for weather display)
#   - lon: Longitude for local weather (required for weather display)
#   - routes: List of train routes (e.g., ["B", "C"])
#   - directions: Custom labels for UPTOWN/DOWNTOWN sections
#
# Find stop IDs at: http://web.mta.info/developers/data/nyct/subway/Stations.csv
# Find coordinates via Google Maps (right-click a location > select coordinates)

# SERVER CONFIGURATION
# ============================================================================
server:
  host: "0.0.0.0"  # Listen on all interfaces (default: 0.0.0.0)
  port: 5000       # Flask server port (default: 5000)
#
# The script automatically:
#   - Determines which MTA feed to use based on routes
#   - Adds N/S suffixes for northbound/southbound
#   - Fetches both directions
#   - Consolidates trains by station, sorted by arrival time

# Number of upcoming trains to display per direction
num_trains: 10

# Dynamic refresh rate based on device proximity
# The display refreshes more frequently when configured devices are nearby
#
# IMPORTANT: Disable MAC randomization/Private Wi-Fi Address on your devices!
#   - iPhone: Settings → Wi-Fi → (i) next to network → Turn OFF "Private Wi-Fi Address"
#   - Android: Settings → Wi-Fi → Network → Advanced → Privacy → "Use device MAC"
#   Without this, your phone will use a random MAC address that changes frequently,
#   making presence detection unreliable.
#
# How to find your device's MAC address:
#   - Router/network admin panel: Check connected devices list (most reliable)
#   - iPhone: Settings > General > About > Wi-Fi Address
#   - Android: Settings > About Phone > Status > Wi-Fi MAC Address
#   - macOS: System Settings > Network > Wi-Fi > Details > Hardware
#   - Linux: Run 'ip link show' or 'ifconfig' in terminal
#   - Command line: ssh into Pi and run 'sudo arp-scan --localnet' to see all devices
#
# Parameters:
#   - devices: List of device MAC addresses to monitor for proximity
#              Format: "xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx" (colons, not hyphens - case-insensitive)
#              Example: "68:44:65:21:50:36" ✓  NOT "68-44-65-21-50-36" ✗
#   - intervals: Refresh intervals in SECONDS for different states
#       - fast: When devices are detected nearby (recommended: 60 = 1 minute)
#       - slow: When no devices detected (recommended: 1800 = 30 minutes)
#       - night: During night hours regardless of presence (recommended: 1800 = 30 minutes)
#   - night_hours: Time range when night interval applies
#       - start: Hour to begin night mode (24-hour format, e.g., 1 = 1 AM)
#       - end: Hour to end night mode (24-hour format, e.g., 7 = 7 AM)
#   - detection_method: Method to detect device presence ("arp-scan" recommended)
#
refresh_rate:
  devices:
    - "68:44:65:21:50:36"  # Example: Your iPhone (use colons, not hyphens!)
    - "10:da:63:63:45:28"  # Example: Partner's Android phone
  intervals:
    fast: 60               # Refresh every 60 seconds (1 minute) when devices are home
    slow: 1800             # Refresh every 1800 seconds (30 minutes) when no devices are home
    night: 1800            # Refresh every 1800 seconds (30 minutes) during night hours (1 AM - 7 AM)
  night_hours:
    start: 1               # Night mode starts at 1 AM
    end: 7                 # Night mode ends at 7 AM
  detection_method: "arp-scan"
