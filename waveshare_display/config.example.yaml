display:
  # Hardware version of your Waveshare 2.13" E-Paper HAT
  # Check the label on your HAT - it will say V2, V3, or V4
  # V2: Older model with black/white only
  # V3: Newer model with improved refresh (RECOMMENDED)
  # V4: Latest model (no partial refresh support)
  version: "V3"

  # Refresh interval in SECONDS
  # Since the display is powered by the Pi (no battery), we can refresh frequently
  # Recommended: 30-60 seconds
  refresh_interval: 30

  # Partial refresh settings
  # Partial refreshes are faster but can cause ghosting after many updates
  # The display will automatically do a full refresh every N partial updates
  max_partial_refreshes: 10  # Full refresh after this many partial updates

# ============================================================================
# PRESENCE DETECTION (Optional)
# ============================================================================
# If configured, the display will show HOME/AWAY status based on device presence
# Uses the same presence detection as subway_train_times
# If not configured, presence status won't be shown
